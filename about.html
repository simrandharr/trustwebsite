      <h2>About the Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Established in August 2024, our Trust was founded with a steadfast commitment to promoting social welfare and
        inclusive development. By creating opportunities, nurturing hope, and inspiring collective action, we aim to
        transform lives and contribute to a more inclusive and progressive future.

        Though we are a recently registered entity, we have made remarkable progress in a short span of time. Backed by
        a dedicated team, committed donors, and the unwavering support of well-wishers, we have successfully launched
        and implemented several projects that not only address urgent needs but also empower individuals and communities
        in the long term. </p>
