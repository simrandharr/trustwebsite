      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Established in August 2024, our trust was founded with a steadfast commitment to
        promoting social welfare and inclusive development. Guided by the core values of
        compassion, equity, and service, we are dedicated to uplifting underprivileged and
        marginalized communities by bridging the gap between opportunity and need through
        impactful, sustainable initiatives. Despite being a recently registered entity, our trust has
        achieved meaningful progress within a short span. Backed by a passionate team,
        committed donors, and the unwavering support of well-wishers, we have successfully
        launched and executed several projects that not only address immediate concerns but also
        empower individuals and communities in the long term. Our interventions span multiple
        focus areas, including education, healthcare, livelihood training, women’s empowerment,
        cultural awareness through ritual value initiatives, and support for the elderly and
        differently-abled. Each program is designed with a holistic perspective to ensure lasting,
        transformative outcomes for our beneficiaries. As we step into the financial year 2025
        2026, we remain committed to scaling up our efforts and deepening our impact. The
        following sections detail our key activities undertaken during the past year, along with a
        roadmap for our initiatives in the upcoming period of 2025-2026 . </p>
