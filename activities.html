        <p>Recognizing the hardships faced by those living below the poverty line,
          especially during the harsh winters, our trust distributed woollen
          clothes to needy families residing in remote areas of Jammu (Muthi,
          Barnai, Patoli, Nagrota). Volunteers personally visited these areas to
          ensure that warm clothing reached those who required it the most. This
          initiative provided relief to many individuals, especially children and
          elderly people, protecting them from the cold and improving their

          growth. By providing this assistance, we aim to empower children with

          underprivileged orphan students amounting to around Rs.90,000 till

        <p>Last year, our Trust organized a religious conference focused on promoting
          spiritual values and cultural tradition. The event brought together renowned
          spiritual leaders and scholars who delivered enlightening talks on Sanatan
          Dharma, devotion, and ethical living. The conference received an excellent
          response from the community and served as a significant platform for spiritual
          dialogue and inspiration. Special attention was given to themes such as <strong>Sanatan
            Dharma, Bhakti Marg,</strong> and <strong>the role of seva (selfless service)</strong> in spiritual
          growth.
          The event not only fostered a deeper understanding of our sacred traditions but
          also inspired the youth to connect with their roots. We are grateful for the
          enthusiastic support of our volunteers, donors, and participants, whose collective
          efforts made the conference a spiritually uplifting and memorable experience.</p>
